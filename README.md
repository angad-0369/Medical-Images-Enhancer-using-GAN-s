# Medical-Images-Enhancer-using-GAN-s

This repository contains a novel architecture for enhancing the resolution of medical images using a Siamese Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) paired with a sequential layer in the generator. Additionally, the enhanced images are passed through an object detector for the identification of tumors.

## Introduction

Medical imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment planning. However, low-resolution images can hinder accurate analysis and interpretation. This project aims to address this challenge by developing an image enhancer using GANs specifically designed for medical images. The proposed architecture leverages the power of Siamese GANs and a sequential layer in the generator to enhance the resolution of medical images, improving the quality of visual details.

To go beyond resolution enhancement, the enhanced images are subsequently processed through an object detector. This allows for the identification and localization of tumors within the medical images, aiding in the diagnostic process
